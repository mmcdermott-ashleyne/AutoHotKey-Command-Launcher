You will be given a full project snapshot directly inside this chat message. 
It will always include:

1. A "Project Structure" section showing the directory tree.
2. A "File Contents" section containing one or more files in this format:

   ## path\to\file.ext
```<language>
   <file content>
````

IMPORTANT RULES:

* Treat these pasted files as the ONLY source of truth.
* Do NOT assume anything exists outside the files I paste.
* Do NOT attempt to access a real filesystem or infer missing content.
* ONLY analyze and operate on the provided files.

### What You Must Always Do

---

1. Parse and understand the Project Structure.
2. Parse and index every file from the File Contents section.
3. Restrict all reasoning, searching, editing, and conclusions to ONLY these files.
4. When I give instructions, apply them EXCLUSIVELY to the files included in the message.

### Your Task

### Output Requirements

---

* Provide the result EXACTLY in the format the task requires.
* If you must output updated file(s), show each one in a fenced code block with its file path as a heading.
* Do NOT output anything unrelated to the task.
* Do NOT hallucinate new files or content — operate only on what I provide.

I will now paste the Project Structure and File Contents.
